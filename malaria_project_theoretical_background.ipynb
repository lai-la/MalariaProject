    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The general topic of this project is to use Artificial Intelligence (AI), namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect malaria in blood cell images.\n",
    "Being a life-threatening disease, malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites being transmitted to humans by the bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes [1]. There are five parasite species responsible for malaria in humans. Two of them represent the biggest threat:\n",
    "P. falciparum, responsible for 99.7% of the estimated malaria cases in african countries.\n",
    "P. vivax, responsible for about 74.1% of the malaria cases in the Americas. The World Malaria Report 2018 states that amongst the areas where malaria cases increased by more than 20% is the WHO Region of the Americas [2]. 84% of that increase is due to malaria cases reported in Venezuela.\n",
    "Even though malaria can be cured and prevented, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), almost half of the world’s population was at risk of it in 2017. \n",
    "An article of the Korean Journal of Parasitology referenced by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) written by N. Tangpukdee et al. states that the microscopic diagnosis of malaria requires a well trained microscopist [3]. In regions where malaria isn’t endemic any longer, its diagnosis can be difficult because clinicians might not consider it as a possible cause. Microscopists might also fail to detect it, as they are not familiar with malaria and would possibly not recognize the parasites.\n",
    "An important aspect of the proposed topic is that it is a great example of how AI can be used to save human lives. A CNN can be trained to be pretty proficient at detecting the disease. Once trained it can be used easily without producing a lot of costs and might therefore help to facilitate malaria diagnosis significantly.\n",
    "Automatic identification of infected cells in general [4] and malaria infected cells in particular [5] has been studied by various research groups. CNNs are known to produce high accuracy results for image recognition problems and require little input from human experts besides labelled image data. According to Saurabh Yadav (Medium), CNNs are ”The most successful type of models for image analysis till date” [6].\n",

    "# Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Neural Networks flatten the image in order to process it. By doing so the image depth gets lost whilst Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) preserve it. According to the course notes of Andrey Karpathy[1] CNNs expect to obtain images as input. Due to that some properties can be encoded into the architecture of the CNN. This makes implementing the forward pass more efficient and reduces the number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about CNNs there are two important concepts to understand:\n",
    "   - Shared Parameters\n",
    "   - Receptive Fields\n",
    "   \n",
    "In Regular Neural Networks with Fully-Connected Layers there is one learnable parameter per pixel. CNNs work with convolutions. To do a convolution a filter or kernel is slid or convolved across the image performing an inner product between itself and the pixels of the image it is \"filtering\". This is where the concept of shared parameters fits in as the network will learn one parameter by applying the filter to a group of pixels. The output of this covolution, the activation layer, is then being used as input for the next layer. There are different types of kernels. The deeper the network gets the more specified the kernels will be. This means that the kernels at the start of the network will be the ondes detecting more general features like edges, circles and basic forms. The kernels deeper within the network are getting more and more specific and will be able to recognize more specified features like for example ears, legs, dogs, eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The receptive field corresponds to the kernel-size. It's size is crucial then it comes to visual tasks as it needs to be large enough to capture specific content and ensure no important information gets lost.[2] In Fully Connected Network the value of each neuron depends on the entire input whilst in CNNs it only depends on a specific region of the image. This region is called the receptive field of the neuron. However if the kernel gets too big the output will get very small very quickly. This is there padding, which will be explained in more detail in the layer section, comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections will explain the different types of layers that CNNs are made of. Introduce some CNN architectures that have been successful in the past and some that are state-of-the art today. In the end some examples will be given where CNNs have been used for medical image classification.\n",

    "   - **Stride:** the stride represents the step width the kernel will use when convolving across the image.\n",
    "   - **Padding:** extends the size of the input to preserve the input dimensions for the output.\n",
    "Lets pretend we have an input image I with dimensions [4x4x3] and a Kernel of size [3x3]. As mentioned above the dimension of the kernel allways corresponds to the depth of the input which means that the dimension of the kernel k is [3x3x3]. \n",

    "Deciding on which CNN architecture to use is quite difficult as there is no concrete answer to that question. According to Andrey Karpathys Lecture notes[https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/] one should use a neural network as large as the accessible computational power allows it because the larger the network the larger the space of representable functions.\n",
    "Karpathy mentions that CNNs usually follow the following architecture pattern:\n",
    "`INPUT -> [[CONV -> RELU]*N -> POOL?]*M -> [FC -> RELU]*K -> FC`\n",
    "    - 0 <= N <= 3\n",
    "    - M >= 0\n",
    "    - 0 <= K < 3 (usually)\n",
    "    - * : repetition\n",
    "    - ? : optional\n",
    "He also says that there are very few situations where a CNN need to be trained from scratch and recommends using a pretrained model, with the currently best working architecture, from ImageNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding layer sizing patterns there are some recommendations:\n",
    " - **Input Layer:** Should be divisible by 2\n",
    "  \n",
    " - **Conv Layer:**\n",
    "     - use small kernels K: 3x3 and at most 5x5\n",
    "     - use stride S = 1\n",
    "     - Zero-Padding so that output dimension corresponds to input dimension. Which is the case when the following equation is applied.\n",
    "      \n",
    "     \\begin{equation}\n",
    "         P = \\frac{K-1}{2}\n",
    "     \\end{equation}\n",
    "      \n",
    "     \n",
    " - **Pooling Layer:** Here the most common way is to use K=2, S=2 and MAX-Pooling\n",
    " \n",
    "Over the years different types of CNN-Architectures haven been reducing the top-5 loss on imagenet.[https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/five-powerful-cnn-architectures-b939c9ddd57b] The first one to significantly drop that loss, from 26% to 15.3%, was AlexNet in 2012. In 2014 the VGGNet made it's appearance in the same challenge, together with GoogLeNet/Inception which won the competition dropping the loss to 6.67%. ResNet appeared in 2015 and took the loss down to 3.57%. \n",
    "Today state of the art might be ResNet or googles Inception. New architectures keep appearing, one of them is DenseNet which was used to detect infected malaria cells in the [densenet_implementation_kernel](https://github.com/lai-la/MalariaProject/blob/master/malaria_project_densenet_implementation.ipynb) belonging to this notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our main focus is on Tensorflow and therefore Keras. Keras provides a DenseNet implementation which we are using in our malaria_project_densenet_implementation.ipynb Kernel. The Keras documentation references a paper called “Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (CVPR 2017 Best Paper Award)”. \n",
    "\n",
    "A DenseNet is a CNN architecture published in 2016. The main difference between traditional CNNs and the DenseNet is the density of the connected layers. Every layer is connected to every other layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since all layers are connected each one gets additional inputs from all previous layers. Those features maps get concatenated. Layer x has x inputs. The concatenated feature maps are the global state of the network. The global state is available to all layers in the network and therefore does not have to be recalculated or replicated over and over again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is that the DenseNet needs fewer parameters because the feature maps are passed directly to all the following layers and do not have to be calculated again.Narrow layers with a low number of filters create small feature maps to pass on and to add to the global state. It is efficient to train short connections from input to output.\n",
    "The computational power needed to perform the training is lower due to the parameter efficiency. In consequence the efficiency to train the model increases and the time to do so decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore is the DenseNet a solution to the vanishing gradient problem. The vanishing gradient problem describes the washing out process of the input which decreases to insignificance as it passes through the layers. Activation functions map inputs into a small range. Even a large input change won’t make a significant difference in the output. The gradient is small. After some activation mappings into a continuously smaller range, the output can’t be changed even by big changes in the weights. The DenseNet solves this issue by shorting the way of the gradient through the network. Conquering the vanishing gradient problem allows the construction of deeper CNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing the feature maps reuse and thereby the information flow through the network results in a regularizing effect also on small datasets and prevents overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the new architecture results in higher accuracy (see Table 2). \n",

    "## CNNs for cell image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Classifying cells is a challenging task. It is often crucial for medical diagnosis, the prevention of diseases and also for personalized treatment. Correct classification with high precision is extremely difficult, not only for computer vision but also for specialists. [1]\n",
    "Using CNNs for cell classification tasks has proven to be very efficient in some cases. Different research groups have obtained Results where the predictions made by the ConvNet have outperformed those obtained by specialists.[1]\n",
    "The high amount of papers written on the subject of using CNNs for different kinds of cell image classification underlines the importance of the topic. Whether it is for classifying Human Epithelial-2 (HEp-2) Cells, which are important for the diagnosis of several autoimmun diseases [3] or to differenciate between normal breast epithelial, an agressive and a less agressive form of breast cancer,[1] or again to detect malaria in blood cells[2].\n",
    "Malaria, as mentioned before, is a global health threat.[5] It caused 438.000 deaths in 2014 and has an economic inpact of about 12 billion dollar per year. Malaria is usually diagnosed visually by technicians who analyze smears of blood with a microscope. The accuracy of the diagnosis therefore depends on the experience of the technician.\n",
    "Being a curable disease Malaria could be cured and also prevented and controlled in a more effective way if it's diagnosis would be more accurate.\n",
    "In the paper by Dong et al. a 17 layer CNN has been used for the task of detecting malaria in blood smears. For the training 27.578 images, with an equal number of uninfected and infected cells, were used. Those images had been normalized and preprocessed to have the dimensions 44x44x3. 90% of the data was then used for training and the remaining 10 % were used for backpropagation validation. They compared the model to a transger learning model and obtained much better results with the new model. The accuracy was 97,37% and the F1 score 97,36%.\n",
    "All this is to show that CNNs have an enormous potential to be used to help saving lifes and if used in the right places maybe also to make good diagnosis accessible in an economic way to a bigger part of the earth population.\n",

The derivative with respect to the loss function would be the same for every weight and would not changed in the next iteration and therefore not in any iteration. \n",
    "Also random weights are problematic since they facilitate vanishing gradients and exploding gradients. Vanishing gradients are explained in the DenseNet section. Exploding gradients result from positive, large weights in combination with small activations. The formula weight - activation * cost shows, that big weights can produce big steps towards the minima. So big that they can be to big to pinpoint the optimum. The best practice for initializing weights depends on the activation function as we have seen with the vanishing and exploding gradient problems. Relu activation function is robust and allows bigger weights. With a normal distribution and a variance the weights can be calculated as follows:\n",

    "## Regularization\n",
    "Regularization generalizes the learning algorithm with small modifications to the network to reduce overfitting. Overfitting is a term to describe a poor training process of a network, which adapts too much to the training data and underperforms on the test data. Commonly used regularization techniques are L2 & L1 regularization, Dropout and Data Augmentation. \n"

    "## Data Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is know that a bigger data set improves the accuracy of an image classifier simply by providing more training data. Lack of data can be a problem especially in the medical sector because of the highly delicate nature of the data. The privacy concerns towards health related data do have the side effect of insufficient data gathering. Data augmentation could be a helpful way to close that gap. Small data sets are risking to train an overfitting CNN. With increasing size the data set will minimize the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are two options for us to increase the size of our malaria cell image data set by data augmentation. One is to make the set as big as possible as has been shown by Google while training their Google Speech with a trillion words corpus. The second possibility is to thoughtfully decide on specific data augmentation techniques to use and enhance the data set carefully by proven and filtered features. The first option is tempting unfortunately we don’t have the training resources for that amount of data. So we will choose the second option and we will decide on specific data augmentation techniques to carefully increase the amount of reliable data and hence improve the accuracy of our CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of data augmentation features depends on the data we are dealing with. Our dataset consists of low quality images of roughly the same structure and size. The images are quite homogenous without many angles or colour differences, nor do they have blurry parts or weather differences. Still they vary in a small range and we will try to optimize the data set accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The malaria cell images do not have a top or bottom, left or right, which means the cells images are provided in any random rotation. Therefore it is beneficial to teach the CNN to identify cell images from every rotation and we will rotate the original cell images in various angels. The same goes for flipping the images. There is no right way in taking a cell image, so we will adapt the data set and add a flipped version of all images. The color of the cell images depends on the camera and its configuration. Some images are brighter, some are darker. By changing the color palette of the duplicated images we will improve our data set even further.\n",

    "## Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Frameworks like Keras allow the user to use optimizers easily. This section will not explain the maths behind the different algorithms but just introduce the most famous ones quickly to get an idea of what to use.\n",
    "Optimizers are used to minimize the cost or loss. The most famous one used to optimize Neural Networks is Gradient Decent.[1] However there are three variants of Gradient Decent (GD):\n",
    " - Batch-GD: used on the entire dataset, this means that all gradients have to be computed in order to perform one update. It can be very slow and might not fit into memory. It also risks to stay trapped in local minima or saddle points. It is not commonly used in practice as an optimizer for CNNs.\n",
    " - Stochastic-GD: Performs one update per parameter. It is much faster and can be used for online learning. Eventually local minima and saddle points can be crossed.\n",
    " - Mini-batch-GD: performs an update on a batch of usually <256 training examples. It combines the best of Gd and SGD and is often used in Neural Networks.\n",
    " \n",
    "There are also a lot of GD optimization algorithms. Some of the most prominent ones are:\n",
    "  - Momentum: accelerates SGD and reduce the oscillations usually observed within SGD. This is achieved by adding a friction. It is often explained with a ball rolling down a hill accumulating velocity unless there is some resistence slowing it down. This is basically what is used for the parameter update when using momentum: updates are reduced for gradients that change direction and get bigger for those who don't. The advantages are that convergence is obtained quicker and that there are less risks to get trapped in saddle points or local minima.\n",
    "  - Adaptive Learning Rate Methods: Each gradient gets adjusted in an adaptive way. The idea behind those algorithms, like Adagrad, is to find a more or less straight path leading to the minimum.\n",
    "  - RMSProp: Also an adaptive learning rate method, that has not been published but introduced in a lecture by Geoff Hinton. RMS stands for Root-Mean-Square. It prevents us from having an early-dying lerning rate. RMSProp and AdaDelta are pretty similar.\n",
    "  - Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimator): Adam is the most commonly used optimizer when doing image classification. The Algorithm combines the adaptive learning rate and the momentum principle.\n",

    "CNNs are the perfect choice when working on image classification tasks. This project tried to give a brief overview of what to consider when starting such a project. In practice it is extremly rare to build a CNN from scratch and frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras make the task much easier. In the kernels accomanying this notebook a lot of the functions have been implemented by us to gain a better understanding of what actually happens.\n",
