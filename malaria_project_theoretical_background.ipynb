    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The general topic of this project is to use Artificial Intelligence (AI), namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect malaria in blood cell images.\n",
    "Being a life-threatening disease, malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites being transmitted to humans by the bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes [1]. There are five parasite species responsible for malaria in humans. Two of them represent the biggest threat:\n",
    "P. falciparum, responsible for 99.7% of the estimated malaria cases in african countries.\n",
    "P. vivax, responsible for about 74.1% of the malaria cases in the Americas. The World Malaria Report 2018 states that amongst the areas where malaria cases increased by more than 20% is the WHO Region of the Americas [2]. 84% of that increase is due to malaria cases reported in Venezuela.\n",
    "Even though malaria can be cured and prevented, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), almost half of the world’s population was at risk of it in 2017. \n",
    "An article of the Korean Journal of Parasitology referenced by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) written by N. Tangpukdee et al. states that the microscopic diagnosis of malaria requires a well trained microscopist [3]. In regions where malaria isn’t endemic any longer, its diagnosis can be difficult because clinicians might not consider it as a possible cause. Microscopists might also fail to detect it, as they are not familiar with malaria and would possibly not recognize the parasites.\n",
    "An important aspect of the proposed topic is that it is a great example of how AI can be used to save human lives. A CNN can be trained to be pretty proficient at detecting the disease. Once trained it can be used easily without producing a lot of costs and might therefore help to facilitate malaria diagnosis significantly.\n",
    "Automatic identification of infected cells in general [4] and malaria infected cells in particular [5] has been studied by various research groups. CNNs are known to produce high accuracy results for image recognition problems and require little input from human experts besides labelled image data. According to Saurabh Yadav (Medium), CNNs are ”The most successful type of models for image analysis till date” [6].\n",

Due to that some properties can be encoded into the architecture of the CNN. This makes iplementing the forward pass more efficient and reduces the number of parameters.\n"

    "## Data Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is know that a bigger data set improves the accuracy of an image classifier simply by providing more training data. Lack of data can be a problem especially in the medical sector because of the highly delicate nature of the data. The privacy concerns towards health related data do have the side effect of insufficient data gathering. Data augmentation could be a helpful way to close that gap. Small data sets are risking to train an overfitting CNN. With increasing size the data set will minimize the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are two options for us to increase the size of our malaria cell image data set by data augmentation. One is to make the set as big as possible as has been shown by Google while training their Google Speech with a trillion words corpus. The second possibility is to thoughtfully decide on specific data augmentation techniques to use and enhance the data set carefully by proven and filtered features. The first option is tempting unfortunately we don’t have the training resources for that amount of data. So we will choose the second option and we will decide on specific data augmentation techniques to carefully increase the amount of reliable data and hence improve the accuracy of our CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of data augmentation features depends on the data we are dealing with. Our dataset consists of low quality images of roughly the same structure and size. The images are quite homogenous without many angles or colour differences, nor do they have blurry parts or weather differences. Still they vary in a small range and we will try to optimize the data set accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The malaria cell images do not have a top or bottom, left or right, which means the cells images are provided in any random rotation. Therefore it is beneficial to teach the CNN to identify cell images from every rotation and we will rotate the original cell images in various angels. The same goes for flipping the images. There is no right way in taking a cell image, so we will adapt the data set and add a flipped version of all images. The color of the cell images depends on the camera and its configuration. Some images are brighter, some are darker. By changing the color palette of the duplicated images we will improve our data set even further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not yet decided:\n",
    "The images will be processed as uint8 arrays. Uint8 arrays are very suitable for data augmentation tools. Our choice of image augmentation library will be imgaug. All needed features are available and easy to use.\n",
