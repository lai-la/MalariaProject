    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The general topic of this project is to use Artificial Intelligence (AI), namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect malaria in blood cell images.\n",
    "Being a life-threatening disease, malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites being transmitted to humans by the bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes [1]. There are five parasite species responsible for malaria in humans. Two of them represent the biggest threat:\n",
    "P. falciparum, responsible for 99.7% of the estimated malaria cases in african countries.\n",
    "P. vivax, responsible for about 74.1% of the malaria cases in the Americas. The World Malaria Report 2018 states that amongst the areas where malaria cases increased by more than 20% is the WHO Region of the Americas [2]. 84% of that increase is due to malaria cases reported in Venezuela.\n",
    "Even though malaria can be cured and prevented, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), almost half of the world’s population was at risk of it in 2017. \n",
    "An article of the Korean Journal of Parasitology referenced by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) written by N. Tangpukdee et al. states that the microscopic diagnosis of malaria requires a well trained microscopist [3]. In regions where malaria isn’t endemic any longer, its diagnosis can be difficult because clinicians might not consider it as a possible cause. Microscopists might also fail to detect it, as they are not familiar with malaria and would possibly not recognize the parasites.\n",
    "An important aspect of the proposed topic is that it is a great example of how AI can be used to save human lives. A CNN can be trained to be pretty proficient at detecting the disease. Once trained it can be used easily without producing a lot of costs and might therefore help to facilitate malaria diagnosis significantly.\n",
    "Automatic identification of infected cells in general [4] and malaria infected cells in particular [5] has been studied by various research groups. CNNs are known to produce high accuracy results for image recognition problems and require little input from human experts besides labelled image data. According to Saurabh Yadav (Medium), CNNs are ”The most successful type of models for image analysis till date” [6].\n",

    "According to the course notes of Andrey Karpathy[http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/] Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) expect to obtain images as input. Due to that some properties can be encoded into the architecture of the CNN. This makes iplementing the forward pass more efficient and reduces the number of parameters.\n"
